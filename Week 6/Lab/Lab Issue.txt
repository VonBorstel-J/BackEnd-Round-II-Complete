This lab assessment is incomplete I am having a lot of trouble with mongoose and I am not totally sure why 


/node_modules/mongoose/lib/connection.js:428 throw new MongooseError('The uri parameter to openUri() must be a ' + ^ MongooseError: The uri parameter to openUri() must be a string, got "undefined". Make sure the first parameter to mongoose.connect() or mongoose.createConnection() is a string. 



this is the error I am given I have uninstalled and reinstalled mongodb, as well as the node modules and all of the dependencies.
